# airport security system at a busy airport. 
# Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution 
# λ1 = 5 per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate 1 = 0.2 minutes) 
# to the ID/boarding-pass check queue, 
# several servers with exponential service time 
# with mean rate 2 = 0.75 minutes. 
# [Hint: model them as one block that has more than one
# resource.] After that, the passengers are assigned to the shortest 
# of the several personal-check queues, where they go through the 
# personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 minutes and 1 minute). Use the Arena software (PC users) or Python with SimPy (PC or Mac users) to build a simulation of the system, and then vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues to determine how many are needed to keep average wait times below 15 minutes. [If you’re using SimPy, or if you have access to a non-student version of Arena, you can use λ1 = 50 to simulate a busier airport.]
